    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
      //team[3] = 'Dan'
    // now here is the problem!
    //console.log(players)
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3]='Dan'
    console.log(players)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team4[3] = 'Ben'
    team5[3] = 'Emily'
    console.log(players)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.age=99
    //console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = {...person}
    const cap3 = Object.assign({},person,{age:99, number:476});
    console.log(cap3)
    cap2.age=99
    console.log(person)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
